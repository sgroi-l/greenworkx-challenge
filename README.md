# greenworkx challenge

This project implements a matching algorithm that helps users find their top career matches based on their preferences and job data. The algorithm normalises user input, calculates match scores for each job, and returns the top three matches.

## Installation

To run the matching algorithm, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you don't have them already, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/sgroi-l/greenworkx-challenge
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd greenworkx-challenge
```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

The main functionality of the matching algorithm is exported as a Node.js module, which can be used in other files. Additionally, the project uses the Jest library for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```

This will execute the test suites defined in the test directory using Jest and display the test results.
